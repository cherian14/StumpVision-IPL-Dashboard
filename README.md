## ✨ Core Features & Technical Highlights

This isn't just a scorecard; it's a data goldmine. This project dives deep into IPL data (2008-2024) to showcase end-to-end data science skills.

*   **🔮 AI-Powered Predictions:** Go beyond analysis and predict match outcomes with a `RandomForestClassifier` model, factoring in team strength, toss decisions, and venue history. Model performance metrics and feature importance are displayed transparently.

*   **👑 Advanced Player Metrics:** Uncover the true story behind the numbers with custom-engineered features:
    *   **True Average & True Strike Rate:** Normalizes a batsman's performance against match difficulty.
    *   **Combined Bowling Rate (CBR):** A single, powerful metric to evaluate bowler effectiveness.
    *   **Player Form Score:** A weighted score to quantify a player's recent performance.

*   **🔬 Deep-Dive Analysis:**
    *   **Player Insights:** A dedicated section to analyze any player's career stats, from centuries to bowling economy.
    *   **Phase-Wise Dynamics:** Break down team performance in the **Powerplay**, **Middle Overs**, and **Death Overs**.

*   **🎨 Interactive & Sleek UI:** A fluid user experience built with Streamlit, featuring dynamic Plotly charts and user-friendly filters for intuitive data exploration.
